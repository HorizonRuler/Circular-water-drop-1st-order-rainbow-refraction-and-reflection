This LateX file contains a TikZ drawing that accurately draws the path of light through a circular medium as it is refracted upon entry, reflected at the back, and refracted again upon exit.

You can change the index of refraction of the material, the radius of the circle, and the height above the horizontal diameter the light enters. You will get an accurate diagram as long as height is between 0 and the radius and the index is not unreasonable.
